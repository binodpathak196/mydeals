	<p>Luck is great, but life is meant to be experienced. Sometimes the only way out of stress is through it; face struggle to overcome challenges in life. Many times battle happens to help teach us a lesson. We can either learn from that lesson or deny it.From an evolutionary perspective, the human mind's primary goal is to keep you safe.<br> Sometimes this leads to self-sabotage as it's just easier to stay in your comfort zone and avoid risk. However, great things never come from mediocrity. Quit settling for average and strive for extraordinary.
